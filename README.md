<p>In this project the aim is to predict if the SpaceX's Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully, by using data from the launch sites.  </p>
<p> Here we have the Jupyter notebooks worked for the project. It contains: </p>
<ul>
<li> Data collection: using an API and web scraping from Wikipedia.​</li>
<li> Data Wrangling: converted the landing outcomes to classes, either 0 or 1.​​</li>
<li> Exploratory data analysis: using SQL querying, visualization with matplotlib and seaborn, and interactive visual analytics with Folium and Plotly Dash to find some patterns in the data.​​</li>
<li> Machine learning models: using logistic regression, support vector machine, decision tree classifier, and K nearest neighbors to find the method with highest classification accuracy predicting the landing outcomes.​​</li>
</ul>
